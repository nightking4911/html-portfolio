<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Kurakula Siva Naga Malleswararao from India where I am currently persuing my graduation in AI and Computer science. I have completed my matriculation in Saint Patricks High School with 10 CGPA.
  I did my intermediate course on MPC where i secured 97.3% in 2021. I selected my btech course AI which is most emerging and facinating in present and future days. </p>

<p>My passion is to be a succesfull front end web developer . Its not like i dislike backend and other stuff I just like the work which is recognised. As front end is the part that all the users interacts it is really the most important part .<br /> 
About me I am a very good lazy person as long as the work is not much benificial to me . If I am doing something I like or something usefull ,now you can learn the meanings of perseverance and even workalcohic real life meanings.
